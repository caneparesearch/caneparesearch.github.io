title: Mission and Values 
---

###Our Mission:

* **We develop new science** targeting relevant problems in materials science and chemistry.
* **We develop bits of code** to make our science more exiting.
* **We use computational materials science carefully**, understating its limitations.
* **We strive to identify the limitations of our simulations** when interpreting experiments; particularly **we donâ€™t aim to reproduce obsessively** experimental data. 


###Our Values, as inspiredy by the [materialsvirtuallab](https://materialsvirtuallab.org)

**Integrity**
 
* **We do not discriminate** between races, sex and religions.
* **We are honest and fair** to group members, collaborators and competitors.
* **We have a zero-tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and falsification of results.

**Excellence**

* **We strive for excellence** in our science.
* **We aim to develop scientists** with singificant analytical, technical and communication skills.

**Teamwork**

* **We believe that teamwork** is the key to great science.
* **We share and discuss ideas** freely.
* **We encourage great collaborations**, both within and outside of the group.
* **We contribute actively** to the materials science  and chemistry communities.


###We benefit from general principles developed at [Google, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page#Early_management_style):

* **Don't delegate:** Do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.
* **Don't get in the way if you're not adding value.** Let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else.
* **Don't be a bureaucrat.**
* **Ideas are more important than age.** Just because someone is junior doesn't mean they don't deserve respect and cooperation.
* **Do not stop someone from doing something by saying, "No. Period."** If you say no, you have to help them find a better way to get it done.
