<p>###Our research group believe in the following values:</p>

<p><strong>Integrity</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We do not discriminate between races, sex and religion.</li>
  <li>We are honest and fair to group members, collaborators and competitors.</li>
  <li>We have a zero-tolerance policy towards plagiarism and falsification of results.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Excellence</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We strive for excellence in everything we do.</li>
  <li>We stand by the quality of our science.</li>
  <li>We aim to develop scientists with great analytical, technical and communication skills.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We believe great teamwork is the key to great science.</li>
  <li>We share and discuss ideas freely.</li>
  <li>We strive to build great collaborations, both within and outside of the group.</li>
  <li>We contribute actively to the materials science community.</li>
</ul>

<p>###Our research work benefits from the general principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t delegate:</strong> Do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t get in the way if you’re not adding value.</strong> Let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t be a bureaucrat.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Ideas are more important than age.</strong> Just because someone is junior doesn’t mean they don’t deserve respect and cooperation.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not stop someone from doing something by saying, “No. Period.”</strong> If you say no, you have to help them find a better way to get it done</li>
</ul>
