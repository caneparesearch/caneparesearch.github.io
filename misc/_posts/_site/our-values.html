<p>###Our Mission:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We develop new science</strong> targeting relevant problems in materials science and chemistry.</li>
  <li><strong>We develop bits of code</strong> to make our science more exiting.</li>
  <li><strong>We use computational materials science carefully</strong>, understating its limitations.</li>
  <li><strong>We strive to identify the limitations of our simulations</strong> when interpreting experiments; particularly <strong>we don’t aim to reproduce obsessively</strong> experimental data.</li>
</ul>

<p>###Our Values, as inspiredy by the <a href="https://materialsvirtuallab.org">materialsvirtuallab</a></p>

<p><strong>Integrity</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We do not discriminate</strong> between races, sex and religions.</li>
  <li><strong>We are honest and fair</strong> to group members, collaborators and competitors.</li>
  <li><strong>We have a zero-tolerance policy</strong> towards plagiarism and falsification of results.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Excellence</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We strive for excellence</strong> in our science.</li>
  <li><strong>We aim to develop scientists</strong> with singificant analytical, technical and communication skills.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We believe that teamwork</strong> is the key to great science.</li>
  <li><strong>We share and discuss ideas</strong> freely.</li>
  <li><strong>We encourage great collaborations</strong>, both within and outside of the group.</li>
  <li><strong>We contribute actively</strong> to the materials science  and chemistry communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>###We benefit from general principles developed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page#Early_management_style">Google, Inc.</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t delegate:</strong> Do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t get in the way if you’re not adding value.</strong> Let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t be a bureaucrat.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Ideas are more important than age.</strong> Just because someone is junior doesn’t mean they don’t deserve respect and cooperation.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not stop someone from doing something by saying, “No. Period.”</strong> If you say no, you have to help them find a better way to get it done.</li>
</ul>
