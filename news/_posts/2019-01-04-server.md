We are excited to announce the arrival of our new fileserver **ORION** from [SUPERMICRO](https://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon/C620/X11DPH-T.cfm) and with more than 70 TB disk capacity! This will host our data and part of our computational infrastructure to crank out the analysis of our data.
