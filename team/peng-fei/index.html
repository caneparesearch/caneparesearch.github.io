<p>I am a Year 2 undergraduate student in the Materials Science and Engineering programme at the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National University of Singapore</a>. I am excited to learn more about computational methods and the involvement of material informatics to accelerate the discovery of novel materials! When I am not doing research, I spend my free time working on side-projects involving development of chatbots and web applications. </p>
