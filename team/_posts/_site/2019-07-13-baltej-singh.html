<p>I am working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/mse/">Dept. of Material Science and Engineering</a> of <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg">The National University of Singapore</a> since July, 2019. My research work involve the study of perovskite-related materials for energy applications using state of the art computational methodologies and experimental techniques. 
Following my Bachelor Degree from <a href="http://puchd.ac.in">Panjab University Chandigarh</a>,  I received my Masters in Physics from Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi in 2012. After that I have done my Ph.D from the <a href="http://www.barc.gov.in">Bhabha Atomic Research Centre</a> and <a href="http://www.hbni.ac.in">Homi Bhabha National Institute</a>, Mumbai. During my PhD degree, I have studied the role of phonons in controlling various thermodynamic and transport properties of functional materials. In the free time, I love Punjabi cooking, planting, discussing metaphysics and playing volleyball.</p>
