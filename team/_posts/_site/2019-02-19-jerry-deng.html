<p>In 2014, I completed my undergraduate studies in Materials Science and Engineering at the <a href="http://en.csu.edu.cn">Central South University</a>, China. My final year project was conducted at Monash University (Australia), where I employed density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the mechanical properties of metal organic frameworks. I received my MPhil (2014-2015) and PhD (2015-2018) in Materials Science at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a>, where I studied novel halide perovskites under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Cheetham">Prof. Anthony K. Cheetham FRS</a> and <a href="https://www.asg.msm.cam.ac.uk/group-members/dr-paul-bristowe">Dr. Paul D. Bristowe</a>. I am interested in using first-principles methods, including DFT, to understand and predict properties of energy materials. When I am not doing science, I love travelling and photography.</p>
