I am working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Dept. of Material Science and Engineering](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/mse/) of [The National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg) since July, 2019. My research work involve the study of perovskite-related materials for energy applications using state of the art computational methodologies and experimental techniques. 
Following my Bachelor Degree from [Panjab University Chandigarh](http://puchd.ac.in),  I received my Masters in Physics from Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi in 2012. After that I have done my Ph.D from the [Bhabha Atomic Research Centre](http://www.barc.gov.in) and [Homi Bhabha National Institute](http://www.hbni.ac.in), Mumbai. During my PhD degree, I have studied the role of phonons in controlling various thermodynamic and transport properties of functional materials. In the free time, I love Punjabi cooking, planting, discussing metaphysics and playing volleyball.
