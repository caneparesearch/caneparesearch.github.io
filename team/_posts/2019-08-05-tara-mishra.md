I am a graduate student under the [Singapore (NUS) â€“ MIT Alliance for Research and Technology](https://smart.mit.edu) (SMART). My primary supervisors are Prof. Stephen Pennycook (NUS) and Prof. Silvija Gradecak (MIT). My broad area of interest is synergistic material investigation using atomically resolved microscopy and computational condensed matter physics. In 2018, I completed my undergraduate studies in Materials at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in), Bangalore (IISc, Bangalore). During my bachelors, I worked as a research intern at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (2016) in the determination of thermal vibration from atomically resolved microscopy imaging. For my final year bachelors project at IISc, I worked on three-dimensional structure reconstruction from a single projection atomic resolved microscopy image. I love coding and try my hand at multiple coding languages, such as Python, MATLAB, JAVA, and CUDA C. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and playing Squash.
