In 2014, I completed my undergraduate studies in Materials Science and Engineering at the [Central South University](http://en.csu.edu.cn), China. My final year project was conducted at Monash University (Australia), where I employed density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the mechanical properties of metal organic frameworks. I received my MPhil (2014-2015) and PhD (2015-2018) in Materials Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), where I studied novel halide perovskites under the supervision of [Prof. Anthony K. Cheetham FRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Cheetham) and [Dr. Paul D. Bristowe](https://www.asg.msm.cam.ac.uk/group-members/dr-paul-bristowe). I am interested in using first-principles methods, including DFT, to understand and predict properties of energy materials. When I am not doing science, I love travelling and photography.
