I spent four years majoring in physics at the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](http://www.ucas.ac.cn), China.
In the meantime, I joined several groups at UCAS as well as in American Univeristies. I got increasingly interested in interdisciplinary research. My graduate project was a combination of physics and materials science, and now I am ready to delve into something more challenging and exciting about energy materials mainly by using simulation methods, such as density functional theory. In my spare time, I am a big fan of piano, basketball, and gym exercise.
