## Abstract

We have investigated Mg intercalation into orthorhombic V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, one of only three cathodes known to reversibly intercalate Mg ions. By calculating the ground-state Mg<sub>x</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> configurations and by developing a cluster expansion for the configurational disorder in &delta;-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, a full temperature–composition phase diagram is derived. Our calculations indicate an equilibrium phase-separating behavior between fully demagnesiated &alpha;-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and fully magnesiated &delta;-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, but also motivate the existence of potentially metastable solid solution transformation paths in both phases. We find significantly better mobility for Mg in the &delta; polymorph, suggesting that better performance can be achieved by cycling Mg in the &delta; phase.
