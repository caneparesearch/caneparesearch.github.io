## Abstract

Solid electrolytes for solid-state Li-ion batteries are stimulating considerable interest for next-generation energy storage applications. The LLi<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> garnet-type solid electrolyte has received appreciable attention as a result of its high ionic conductivity. However, several challenges for the successful application of solid-state devices based on Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> remain, such as dendrite formation and maintaining physical contact at interfaces over many Li intercalation/extraction cycles. Here, we apply first-principles density functional theory to provide insights into the Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> particle morphology under various physical and chemical conditions. Our findings indicate Li segregation at the surfaces, suggesting Li-rich grain boundaries at typical synthesis and sintering conditions. On the basis of our results, we propose practical strategies to curb Li segregation at the Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> interfaces. This approach can be extended to other Li-ion conductors for the design of practical energy storage devices.
